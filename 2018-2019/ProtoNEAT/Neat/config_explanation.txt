NEAT Section (REQUIRED)
--> values for the NEAT algorithm itself.
----------------------------------------------------------

- fitness_criterion (min, max, mean)

    Trying to minimize, maximize, or try to get close
     to a mean error.

- fitness_threshold

    Point where the program terminates.
    Program ends when error is minimized, maximized, or
    at the mean threshold error value.

- no_fitness_termination (True, False)

    If True, ignores fitness_criterion and fitness_threshold
    If False, the default, uses fitness_criterion and fitness_threshold

- pop_size

    number of individuals in each generation

- reset_on_extinction (True, False)

    If True, when all species are extinct because of stagnation,
        new random population is created.
    If False, CompleteExtinctionException is thrown



DefaultStagnation Section (ONLY REQUIRED WHEN it is declared in
                            the config file)
*Can be customized
--> parameters for checking if the species are showing improvement
----------------------------------------------------------

- species_fitness_func (min, max, mean, median)

    Defaults to median.
    Computes species fitness

- max_stagnation

    A threshold of generations to determine if species are
    improving. If not improved, it is removed.

- species_elitism

    Used to prevent total extinction, because of stagnation.
    Number given will prevent that amount of species with the highest
    fitness from being removed.
    Defaults to 0.

DefaultReproduction Section (ONLY REQUIRED WHEN it is declared in
                              the config file)
*Can be customized
--> parameters for reproduction of new population
----------------------------------------------------------

- elitism

    Number of most fit individuals in each species that will be
    kept as-is from the current generation to the next.
    Defaults to 0.

- survival_threshold

    Fraction of species allowed to reproduce each generation.
    Defaults to 0.2

- min_species_size

    Minimum number of genomes per species after reproduction.
    Defaults to 2.
